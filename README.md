# Frag
Fragment shaders in Rust.
Let's you skip the boilerplate and just write a fragment shader.
Useful when for example, writing a raymarching shader.
## Features
* Compose shader of multiple part or files
* Live coding: updates when a file is updated
* Resolution independent: separate resolutions for rendering and displaying
